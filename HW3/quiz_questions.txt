You will be randomly asked one of these questions during the grading session:

 - Describe two of the ways we discussed in class on how to compute a ray-triangle
intersection. You do not need to provide all the mathematical details. Just give
enough of the high-level ideas to show that you understand the approaches.

 - Why is transforming a normal vector between object and world space different from
transforming an object between those spaces?

 - Explain the idea of total internal reflection. Conceptually, when does this happen, and
what effect does it have on the transmission of light through a material?

 - What does Beerâ€™s Law say about light as it travels through a medium? How does the
attenuation coefficient come into play with modifying the light intensity appropriately
as the light travels through some distance?
