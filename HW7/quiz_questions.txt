1. What is the purpose of subdivision? Why do we need to move the vertices in the
process after inserting new vertices?
    - Subdivision is the dividing of polygons into smaller polygons which allows for
    smoother curvature/surfaces.
    - New vertices are needed to adjust for the new smoothness of the shape and
    preserve the original's overall dimensions.
    
2. What is the purpose of control points when it comes to splines? What is one practical
application of splines in computer graphics?
    - Control points defnie the shape/curvature of a spline, which is a smooth curve that passes through
    the control points
    - Splines are used for defining motion paths such as for camera movement and more
    importantly are used for applying deformations to objects to make them more realisitc

3. How are implicit surfaces used to model geometry (e.g. a sphere, water, etc)? Why
are they superior to triangle meshes for modeling something like water?
    - Implicit surfaces use mathematical equations to model how a geometric shape's 
    points should lie on a surface
    - They are superior to traingle meshes for water as they allow for more continuous
    representations without the constraints of discrete polgonal meshes and create more
    fluid-like behavior.

4. How is range scanning used to create geometry? Why might we want to use it over
manually creating the geometry ourselves?
    - Range scanning capture the 3D shape of real world objects by mesauring their distances
    to surfaces
    - It's preferred as it's more highly accurate at creating replicas and saves time 
    over detailed manual creation.

5. How does physical simulation (using Newtonâ€™s second law) differ from procedural geometry in shaping geometry? Give an example of when we would use physical simulation
and an example of when we would use procedural geometry in computer graphics.
- Physical simulation uses real world physics to compute how objects behave under forces based on simulations
    rather than relying on algorithms generated using math functions
- Physical simulations: cloth on table
- Procedural: forest using fractals for distribution
