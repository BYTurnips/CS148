You will be randomly asked one of these questions during the grading session:

How does the distance between a light and an object as well as the tilt angle between
the two affect the irradiance on the surface of the object? How does the concept of a
tilt angle also come up for the radiance of (area) lights?


What causes color bleeding in real life? Give a high level description of what we would
need to do with our objects in a scene to model color bleeding


Conceptually, what is a BRDF? How are BRDFs involved in the lighting equation?
For instance, if the incoming radiance is white light, and the BRDF involved models a
blue material object, what might you expect for the color of the outgoing radiance?


What is the difference between the way we compute Gouraud shading vs the way we
compute Phong shading? Which one of these shading techniques produces a more
realistic looking effect, and at what cost?


Explain the ambient, diffuse and specular components of the Phong Reflection Model.
What does each component model visually for the shading of an object?
