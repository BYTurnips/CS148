You will be randomly asked one of these questions during the grading session:

What is the purpose of the aperture of a camera? How does a camera with aperture
differ from a pinhole camera? Which type of camera do we use to model the virtual
world camera?



For which of the three geometric transformations – translation, rotation, and scaling
– do we need homogeneous coordinates in order to represent it as a matrix operation?



How do we apply homogeneous coordinates to composite multiple transformations (of
any of the three types) into 1 matrix operation?



What are two reasons for why we often use triangle meshes to model our objects over
other polygonal meshes? Can you elaborate on one of these reasons?



Why does the order in which we specify the vertices of triangle face matter when it
comes to rendering? By convention, for which orientation of the vertices do we not
render the triangle? And how do we deal with rendering overlapping triangles?



How does barycentric interpolation for triangles compare to linear interpolation for
lines? Conceptually at a high level, what do the barycentric weights α1, α2, and α3
represent for a triangle that is defined by points p1, p2, p3 and has a point p inside?
(We want a high-level answer, not a description of any equations!)
