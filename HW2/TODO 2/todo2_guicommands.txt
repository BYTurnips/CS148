Change GUI to rotate around the global origin.

To make it rotate about the global axes, first go to the Object dropdown menu near the
Object Mode indicator, then select Snap → Cursor to World Origin. If you’re in Edit Mode
instead, then the option will be under the Mesh dropdown menu instead. Then, regardless of
what mode you’re in, set the transform pivot in the dropdown menu next to the Global indicator
to 3D Cursor . Now, if you use the rotate tool or the r keyboard shortcut, you’ll see the rotations
go about the world origin.
