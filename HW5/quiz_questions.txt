- Explain the process of tracing or following photons as they get emitted from a light.
How does this compare to the backward tracing process for photons, and why are both
inefficient compared to ray tracing, despite producing potentially better visual effects?

- How does bidirectional ray tracing achieve a compromise between the efficiency of ray
tracing and better visual fidelity of tracing photons? What is indirect illumination,
and how is it modeled in bidirectional ray tracing?

- Summarize the tractability issue when doing multiple global illumination bounces. How
can we address this issue by looking at the diffuse and specular lighting components
separately?

- What is the advantage of Monte Carlo methods for numerical integration? When might
it be more appropriate to use e.g. Newton-Cotes instead?

- What is the point of photon maps? How are they involved in gathering radiance for
generating effects, such as caustics, indirect lighting, etc, when ray tracing?
